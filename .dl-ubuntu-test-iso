# Sample .dl-ubuntu-test-iso.cfg file. The included settings are the
# default for the script
#

#    RELEASES
#	Which releases of Ubuntu to target. Hardy and Lucid are the
#	only ones currently supported. Defaults to both.
RELEASES="natty"

ISOROOT="$HOME/misc/packages/ubuntu-10.04/isos/"

#    ARCHS
#        Which computer architectures to download. If you only have
#        one, you will want to set this variable to that. Default is
#        all the Ubuntu release architectures.
ARCHS="i386"

#    FLAVORS
#        Which flavors of Ubuntu to download: Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.
#        The default is all of them.
FLAVORS="ubuntu ubuntu-server ubuntu-netbook"

#    VARIANTS
#        Which variants of each flavor to download: desktop cd, alternative
#        cd, server cd, dvd, etc. Default is all of them.
VARIANTS="desktop alternate server netbook"

#    EXCLUDE
#        Which flavors to NOT download. Sometimes it's easier to specify
#        "all, except..." and this allows you to do that. See also the
#        --exclude option above.
EXCLUDE=""

#    OPTS
#        What options to give rsync.
OPTS="-zthhP"

#    NO_ACT
#        If this is set to "yes", then the script won't run rsync, it will
#        just do everything else. See also to --no-act option above.
NO_ACT="no"

#    VERIFY
#        If this is set to "true", then the script will verify the iso's
#        md5sum against the downloaded MD5SUMS file.
#VERIFY="true"

#    BUILD
#        Tell the script to download a specific build of the isos rather
#        than the current iso
#
# Examples
# BUILD="20080715"
# BUILD=$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%m%d)
#
BUILD="current"

#    HOST
#        Tell the script to download from a different mirror than the
#        default
HOST="cdimages.ubuntu.com"

#    DLUSERNAME
#	If http_auth is used on the cdimage server, specify the username
#
# Example
# DLUSERNAME="ubuntu"

#    DLPASSWORD
#	If http_auth is used on the cdimage server, specify the
#	password. Note that zsync does not support a configuration file,
#	and so the script must pass this password on the command line,
#	exposing it to anything that views process listings.
#
# Example
# DLPASSWORD="ubuntu"
